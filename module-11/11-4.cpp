Test a Pen: How would you test a pen?

To illustrate the technique in this problem, let us guide you through a mock conversation.
Interviewer: How would you test a pen?
Candidate: Let me find out a bit about the pen. Who is going to use the pen?
• Interviewer: Probably children.
• Candidate: Okay, that's interesting. What will they be doing with it? Will they be writing, drawing, or
doing something else with it?
Interviewer: Drawing.
Candidate: Okay, great. On what? Paper? Clothing? Walls?
• Interviewer: On clothing.
• Candidate: Great. What kind of tip does the pen have? Felt? Ballpoint? Is it intended to wash off, or is it
intended to be permanent?
Interviewer: It's intended to wash off.
Many questions later, you may get to this:
Candidate: Okay, so as I understand it, we have a pen that is being targeted at 5 to 10-year-olds. The pen
has a felt tip and comes in red, green, blue and black. It's intended to wash off when clothing is washed.
Is that correct?
The candidate now has a problem that is significantly different from what it initially seemed to be. This is
not uncommon. In fact, many interviewers intentionally give a problem that seems clear (everyone knows
what a pen is!), only to let you discover that it's quite a different problem from what it seemed. Their belief
is that users do the same thing, though users do so accidentally.
Now that you understand what you're testing, it's time to come up with a plan of attack. The key here is
structure.
Consider what the different components of the object or problem, and go from there. In this case, the
components might be:
Fact check: Verify that the pen is felt tip and that the ink is one of the allowed colors.
Intended use: Drawing. Does the pen write properly on clothing?
• Intended use: Washing. Does it wash off of clothing (even if it's been there for an extended period of
time)? Does it wash off in hot warm and cold water?
Safety: Is the pen safe (non-toxic) for children?
Unintended uses: How else might children use the pen?They might write on other surfaces, so you need
to check whether the behavior there is correct. They might also stomp on the pen, throw it, and so on.

You'll need to make sure that the pen holds up under these conditions.
Remember that in any testing question, you need to test both the intended and unintended scenarios.
People don't always use the product the way you want them to.
