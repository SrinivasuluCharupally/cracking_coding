Ants on a Triangle: There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of
collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume
that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and
that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.


Ans:


To generalize this to an n-vertex polygon: there are still only two ways in which the ants can move to avoid
a collision, but there are 2" ways they can move in total. Therefore, in general, probability of collision is:
P ( clockwise) = (X)"
P (counter)= (X)"
P (same direction)= 2 (X)" = (X) n-i
P (collision)= 1- P (same direction)= 1- (X)
