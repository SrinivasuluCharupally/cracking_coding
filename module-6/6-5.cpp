Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but
no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs
are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Ans:

first fill 5-jug, take out 3-jug from 5-jug
then 5-jug having 2ltr so poor into 3-jug, now 3-jug have 2ltr.
now fill 5-jug then fill 3-jug from 5-jug, now 5-Jug left with 4ltr.
