Basketball: You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game
or the other?


Ans:

So, we should play Game 1 if0 < p < • 5 and Game 2 if. 5 < p < 1.
lfp = 0,0.5,􀂪r1,thenP(Game 1) = P(Game 2),so it doesn't matterwhichgame we play.
