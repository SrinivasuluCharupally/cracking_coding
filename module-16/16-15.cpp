// MasterMind:TheGameofMasterMindisplayedasfollows:The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit:' If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit:' Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit.For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR , you have one hit and one pseudoÂ­ hitWrite a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.
