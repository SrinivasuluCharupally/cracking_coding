//parse Similarity: The similarity of two documents (each with distinct words) is defined to be the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union. For example, if the documents consist of integers, the similarity of {1, 5, 3} and { 1, 7, 2, 3} is 0. 4, because the intersection has size 2 and the union has size 5.
