// The Masseuse: A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept. She needs a 15-minute break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appointÂ­ ment requests (all multiples of 15 minutes, none overlap, and none can be moved),  nd the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.

// runtime O(n) & space O(1) , optimal solution #4

// recursion takes O(2^n) so this is not recomanded
